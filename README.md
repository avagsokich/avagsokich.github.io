### 2. Gender Pay Gap by Industry

### Source: **[_Forbes Advisor_, "Gender Pay Gap Statistics in 2023", by Kathy Haan and Kelly Reilly](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/gender-pay-gap-statistics/#:~:text=According%20to%20our%20study%2C%20real,women%20in%20the%20same%20role.)**

Background Information:
The gender pay gap has been a persistent issue in workplaces worldwide, raising concerns about gender equality and workplace fairness. Understanding the extent and drivers of this gap is crucial for addressing it effectively. Research on this topic often begins by examining the background factors contributing to the gender pay gap, such as the industries it is most prominent in. Additionally, analyzing data related to salary disparities in various industries is essential for identifying patterns and trends.

Methods:
To investigate the gender pay gap in different industries, I utilized a _Forbes Advisor_ article entitled “Gender Pay Gap Statistics in 2023”. This article contained vast information relating to the different factors that affect equal pay such as: education, demographics and job roles. These datasets can be obtained from sources like government labor departments, surveys, industry-specific databases, and scientific journals which were all cited in the article making it a reliable source. By conducting research and examining these datasets, researchers are able to identify the key factors contributing to pay disparities between genders in specific industries.

Key Findings & Implications:
The key findings of a study on the gender pay gap in industries may reveal significant disparities in earnings between men and women across various sectors. Researchers may uncover that certain industries have narrower pay gaps due to factors like better workplace policies, while others show wider disparities driven by structural or cultural factors. The implications of these findings can be far-reaching, as they can spark the creation of policy changes and workplace initiatives aimed at reducing gender pay disparities. Industries with larger gaps may need to reassess their compensation and promotion practices, while those with smaller gaps can serve as models for improving gender equity in the workforce.

### 9. Average Household Income and the Percentage of Students Going to College 2020

### Background:
### The data in the table examines the relationship between average household income and the percentage of students going to college. This information is vital for addressing questions related to the accessibility of college education. In the United States and many other countries, higher education is often seen as a pathway to better opportunities and improved socio-economic status. However, economic factors play a significant role in determining who can access and afford higher education. This information is crucial for my project focused on the accessibility of college, as it highlights the economic factors that can significantly impact access to higher education. The average household income is a key socioeconomic indicator that can help identify disparities in access to college. Higher income households often have greater resources to support their children's education, such as tuition, test prep, and extracurricular activities. As a result, understanding how household income correlates with college attendance rates is essential for recognizing and addressing potential barriers to higher education. This project can use this data to explore the extent to which economic disparities influence college accessibility and, ultimately, formulate strategies to enhance inclusivity and equal opportunity in higher education. Lastly, for clarification purposes, while making my graph I had to eleminate some of the extra zeros along the x-axis because chartbuilder could not fit all the numbers togther. Therefore, I specified in my title that the numbers along the x-axis are in the thousands for average income. 

### Main Findings:
### The table presents ten hypothetical cases, each with different average household income levels and corresponding percentages of students attending college. What becomes evident is that there is a notable correlation between household income and college attendance. In the cases provided, higher household income tends to be associated with a greater percentage of students going to college. For instance, in Case 5 with an average income of $75,000, 75% of students attend college, while in Case 4 with an average income of $38,200, only 50% of students go to college. These findings underscore the financial constraints that many individuals and families face when pursuing higher education. It highlights the disparities in access to college based on income levels, where students from lower-income households may face barriers to college attendance.

### Implications:
### The implications of these findings are significant for projects focusing on the accessibility of college. They underscore the need to address socio-economic disparities to ensure equal opportunities for higher education. To enhance accessibility, strategies should be developed to provide financial aid, scholarships, and support programs to students from lower-income backgrounds. These initiatives can help level the playing field and make college more accessible to a broader range of individuals.
